# UF-Server-Scripts

--
We, the SysAdmins of a Gaming Community called The United Front, are using this repository to actively work on our scripts that we utilize on our server.
Should there ever come a time when there are more than one person working on it at a time, this will become useful.
for now, we utilize this as a one man army.
for the few, here I am.
