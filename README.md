# UF-Server-Scripts

--
We, the SysAdmins of a Gaming Community called The United Front, are using this repository to actively work on our scripts that we utilize on our server.
Should there ever come a time when there are more than one person working on it at a time, this will become useful.
for now, we utilize this as a one man army.
for the few, here we are.

Eventually, all for our scripts will be run at the same time, right before we start the launch of squad.
These scripts will complete a multitude of tasks.
1 - Update squad, while creating backups of our Configurations
2 - Change the Map Rotation Daily
3 - Update a webpage with our current Map Rotation
4 - Provide Usage Statistics for our squad servers.
5 - One script will start all of these other scripts, based on user logon from server reboot.

These will be knocked out over time, slowly and methodically.

We are currently working on prioritizing each of these options.
